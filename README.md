# Face Detection and Image Capture using OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script that captures images from your webcam and detects faces using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   cd face-detection-opencv

Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install opencv-python


##Usage
Open a terminal and navigate to the repository directory:
cd /path/to/face-detection-opencv
Run the Python script:
python capture_faces.py

3.	The script will capture images from your webcam and detect faces. Press the 'q' key to exit.
4.	The captured face images will be saved in the datastore/viji directory.



##Required Software
Python 3.x
OpenCV (installed via pip as shown above)


##Acknowledgments
This project is based on the OpenCV library and Haar Cascade Classifier.
